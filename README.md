# HTCondor Containers

These container supplement the [HTCondor operator](https://github.com/converged-computing/htcondor-operator).

The builds are done via [this workflow](.github/workflows/build-matrices.yaml)
that uses [uptodate](https://github.com/vsoch/uptodate) on changed files.
Automated builds for each subdirectory is provided, and these examples
are intending to be ported to be run with the Flux Operator.
